# Onetree: a fun little TSP solver.

More is covered in this post (future link here).

This finds exact solutions to smallish (~150 cities) TSP problems.

It uses branch and bound and the Held-Karp approximation.

It is entirely single threaded, though amenable to Rayon in a few places.

It was a toy project of mine; do whatever you'd like with it :)
